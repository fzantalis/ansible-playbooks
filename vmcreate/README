PLAYBOOK OVERVIEW
====================================================================
This playbook runs accross 4 stages.
1. the playbook prepares the server for virtualization.
The playbook checks if the required packages are installed, and if they are missing 
they are installed in order to continue. 
!!! THIS PLAYBOOK IS MADE ON A UBUNTU SERVER 12.04 LTS Server !!!

2. The playbook creates the storage that will be used for the new virtual machine 
based on a Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server template, and then it runs the virt-install command
to create the new virtual amchine

3. After the virtual machine is created, the storage is mounted by the server running the 
ansible script so that it can be configured just before the VM boots for first time

4. After the virtual machine is configured, a little cleanup is begining at the server
(unmounting the storage, romoving nbd module etc...)
Then the VM boots and is ready to go...
