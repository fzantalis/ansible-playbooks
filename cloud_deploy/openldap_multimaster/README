PLAYBOOK OVERVIEW
==================================================================
This playbook helps configuring two servers with openLDAP installed
so that they sync in master master mode.
The installation was done on one server with the scipt "openldap-install/openldap_install.sh"
and then the server was cloned and changed the hostname and ip address
This playbook at first configures the two servers to sync their configuration files
and then they are configured to sync the olcdatabase...

basically there are created some ldif files and then they are added to the ldap schema...

the ldifs can be found on each server's home directory after running the playbook
